I, despite being a voracious reader through my childhood, have never read a Dickens cover to cover. 
My motivations to read this come from wanting to read Demon Copperhead - booker prize winner from 2023. That is a modern retelling of David Copperfield from what I have been able to glean (I don't like to spend time reading reviews pre-reading). 
David Copperfield is a coming of age story and this genre is called bildungsroman - another overly specific German word. It deals with the moral and intellectual growth of the protagonist from childhood to adulthood. I love that this read coincides with my own moral and intellectual growth. 
It is no surprise that David Copperfield is semi autobiographical else I'd think Dickens was a mind reader. Reading David's account is the same as being David himself, you are this child, over analytical and nervous. The goings on around him are immaterial, they're big and depressing, yes but all you want to know is how David's doing. There is a deep sense of concern in the reader's, ahem - my, mind. 

Aside from my first Dickens, this is also my first audiobook. I've been travelling and I felt that was a practical way to make progress. Richard Armitage really brings the characters to life. He does different voices for different characters and the continuity is maintained throughout.
